# Installation

First, make sure the Python 3 version of the following packages are installed:

  * markdown
  * jinja2

On a Debian-derived system this can be accomplished with:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-jinja2 python3-markdown

Then issue the following:

    $ sudo ./setup.py install

You can (obviously) also install it in a virtualenv (which I recommend).
