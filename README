# Jenerator

## About

Jenerator is a static site generator that is designed to be crazy easy to use
and, while providing options for heavy customization, can be easily run on a
simple directory of text files.

## Getting Started

Jenerator was designed to be easy to use, but still reasonably flexible. To set
up a simple skeleton site:

    $ mkdir mysite
    $ jen init

That's it. A default template is configured during initialization, and you
probably want to change it, but you are pretty much ready to go at this point.
Now you can start putting Markdown files in the `pages` subdirectory.  Once you
have some content and you want to build the site for publishing:

    $ jen build

This will cause a directory called `_build` to be created. This directory will
contain everything that needs to be published, just move the contents somewhere
useful.
